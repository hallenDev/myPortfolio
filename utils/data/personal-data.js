    "My code is so meticulously organized they make my sock drawer look chaoticâ€”I've been known to refactor perfectly working functions at 2 AM just because the indentation felt wrong. My superpower? Making complex systems look so simple your grandmother could use them. I believe good documentation is like flossing - everyone knows they should do it, but I'm one of the few who actually does(both!). Currently seeking opportunities where I can build meaningful tech, preferably at places that don't mind the occasional dad joke in code comments. Let's create something awesome together!",
